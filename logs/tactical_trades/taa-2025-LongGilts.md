# Trade Log: 10Y Gilts OW vs USD Cash

- **Trade ID:** TAA-2024-02
- **Status:** Open
- **Strategy Sleeve:** core_taa
- **Entry Date:** 2024-05-15
- **Exit Date:** Open
- **Expression:** +35 bps IGLT (10Y gilts) / -35 bps CASH
- **Sizing Rationale:**

## Thesis
- Setup: UK economy cannot tolerate such high rates indefinitely. Inflation remains high, but focus from the BoE is expected to gradually move towards the employment situation. Fiscal risk premia already largely embedded in current yield levels suggest positive assymmetry in bond prices.
- Macro triggers: expectation of slowing UK data and a turn in BoE rhetoric as inflation normalizes, compressing term premium on the 10Y point.
- Risks / invalidation: reacceleration of inflation (not only sticky prices which are expected), or fiscal slippage that re-prices Gilts wider.

## Implementation & Risk
- Instruments used: +35 bps IGLT funded via -35 bps USD cash sleeve (FX hedged separately within the sleeve).

## Outcome & Review
- Exit rationale: Pending; gitls have shown signs of weaknesses. Positive carry makes this trade easy to hold.
- Monitoring plan: reassess after each BoE meeting and when monthly CPI/utilities policy data are released.
