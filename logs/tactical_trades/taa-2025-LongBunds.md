# Trade Log: 10Y Bunds OW vs USD Cash

- **Trade ID:** TAA-2025-LongBunds
- **Status:** Closed
- **Strategy Sleeve:** core_taa
- **Entry Date:** 2024-05-15
- **Exit Date:** 2025-11-15
- **Expression:** +35 bps DBR 10Y (Bunds) / -35 bps CASH
- **Sizing Rationale:** Initiated as a modest allocation to express a dovish ECB bias driven by downside growth risks and euro strength, while keeping within the standard tactical risk budget.

## Thesis
- Setup: ECB was widely expected to stay on hold, but softening growth implied a lower forward path for rates; euro strength was expected to push the ECB toward a more dovish stance to avoid overtightening.
- Macro triggers: follow-through downside surprises in euro area activity data and confirmation of a patient ECB stance that would allow Bund yields to compress.
- Risks / invalidation: ECB proving more hawkish than priced, fiscal slippage lifting term premia, or Bunds selling off alongside risk assets (questioning their defensive role).

## Implementation & Risk
- Instruments used: +35 bps exposure to 10Y Bund duration (DBR 10Y proxy) funded via -35 bps cash sleeve; FX hedged within the sleeve where appropriate.

## Outcome & Review
- Exit rationale: ECB guidance remained firmer than expected and fiscal pressures kept term premia sticky; Bunds cheapened even during risk-off pulses, undermining the defensive narrative. Seasonal technicals pointed to more pain, so the position was cut to avoid bleed.
- Performance: negative but within risk budgets; no drawdown breaches.
- Key takeaways: structural case for lower Bund yields remains, but the short-term setup failed—hawkish ECB tone plus fiscal expectations outweighed growth softness.
