# Logs

Transparent journals that tie macro thinking to trades:

- `weekly_macro/` – recurring macro & market summaries.
- `tactical_trades/` – lifecycle notes for each trade (thesis → exit).
- `sessions/` – working-session notes, including `last_session.md` for continuity.
- `postmortems/` – deep dives on closed trades to capture lessons.

Use the templates under `docs/templates/` (`weekly_summary.md`, `trade_log.md`, etc.) to keep structure consistent and analytics scripts reproducible.
