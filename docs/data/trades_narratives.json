    "rationale": "- Setup: Recession fears driven by US tariffs policies are warranted, but negative impacts of trade policy likely to take more time to materialise in the data given the inertia of the economy and the strong nominal growth environment. Tariffs inflation fears overstated.\n- Macro triggers: expectation that any tariff-related demand hit would take time to appear in data, while positioning was light after the shock.\n- Risks / invalidation: (initially) genuine negative supply shock showing up earlier than expected, or further escalation in rhethoric between the US and its trading partners. (through the year) clear disappointment around AI.",
    "exit_decision": "chose to head to the sidelines ahead of NVidia earnings (binary outcome with meaningful downside if AI sentiment rolled over), and amid a potential rotation out of tech stocks as the AI theme catches its breath.

    "key_takeaways": "Initial tariff-related policy proved to be justified, though the rationale of the trade evolved over the year towards one of reaching exposure to the AI theme. The strength of the rebound was more than anticipated (which effectiveley benefitted the trade), in spite of recurrent light positioning from institutional investors. The retail 'buy-the-dip' mentality was noticeable.",
    "learning_outcomes": "Over-reaction of markets is a real phenomenon; useful to cross-check positioning and identify where the prevailing market narrative can fall short and be invalidated (in this case: tariffs don't necessarily translate to higher inflation (you need demand for inflation to go up sustainably), and that the economy shows a large degree of inertia). As a general principle, fearmongerers are generally wrong, and don't underestimate the US."
