    "title": "Trade Log: US Equities OW vs USD Cash",
    "rationale": "- Setup: Recession fears driven by US tariffs policies are warranted, but negative impacts of trade policy likely to take more time to materialise in the data given the inertia of the economy and the strong nominal growth environment. Tariffs inflation fears overstated.\n- Macro triggers: expectation that any tariff-related demand hit would take time to appear in data, while positioning was light after the shock.\n- Risks / invalidation: (initially) genuine negative supply shock showing up earlier than expected, or further escalation in rhethoric between the US and its trading partners. (through the year) clear disappointment around AI.",
    "exit_decision": "chose to head to the sidelines ahead of NVidia earnings (binary outcome with meaningful downside if AI sentiment rolled over), and amid a potential rotation out of tech stocks as the AI theme catches its breath. Structurally, however, the AI theme likely to have further to run. May reconsider re-entering the market later.",

    "key_takeaways": "Initial tariff-related policy proved to be justified, though the rationale of the trade evolved over the year towards one of reaching exposure to the AI theme. The strength of the rebound was more than anticipated (which effectiveley benefitted the trade), in spite of recurrent light positioning from institutional investors. The retail 'buy-the-dip' mentality was noticeable.",
    "learning_outcomes": "Over-reaction of markets is a real phenomenon; useful to cross-check positioning and identify where the prevailing market narrative can fall short and be invalidated (in this case: tariffs don't necessarily translate to higher inflation (you need demand for inflation to go up sustainably), and that the economy shows a large degree of inertia). As a general principle, fearmongerers are generally wrong, and don't underestimate the US."

    "rationale": "- Setup: ECB was widely expected to stay on hold, but softening growth implied a lower forward path for rates; euro strength was expected to push the ECB toward a more dovish stance to avoid overtightening.\n- Macro triggers: follow-through downside surprises in euro area activity data and confirmation of a patient ECB stance that would allow Bund yields to compress.\n- Risks / invalidation: ECB proving more hawkish than priced, fiscal slippage lifting term premia, or Bunds selling off alongside risk assets (questioning their defensive role).",
    "exit_decision": "ECB guidance remained firmer than expected and fiscal pressures kept term premia sticky; Bunds cheapened even during risk-off pulses, undermining the defensive narrative. Seasonal technicals pointed to more pain, so the position was cut to avoid bleed.",

    "key_takeaways": "structural case for lower Bund yields remains, but the short-term setup failed—hawkish ECB tone plus fiscal expectations outweighed growth softness.",

    "rationale": "- Setup: UK economy cannot tolerate such high rates indefinitely. Inflation remains high, but focus from the BoE is expected to gradually move towards the employment situation. Fiscal risk premia already largely embedded in current yield levels suggest positive assymmetry in bond prices.\n- Macro triggers: expectation of slowing UK data and a turn in BoE rhetoric as inflation normalizes, compressing term premium on the 10Y point.\n- Risks / invalidation: reacceleration of inflation (not only sticky prices which are expected), or fiscal slippage that re-prices Gilts wider.",
