# Documentation

Reference material to run the process without digging through code:

- `workflow/` – step-by-step data and reporting pipelines.
- `playbooks/` – operational guides or SOPs.
- `templates/` – Markdown/Quarto templates for recurring notes (e.g., `weekly_summary.md`, `trade_log.md`).

Add new guidance here whenever the weekly process evolves.
