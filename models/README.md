# Models

Each sub-folder houses code, configs, and sample outputs for a specific diagnostic. Suggested structure:

- `macro_regime/` – growth/inflation/policy classification.
- `rates_curve/` – PCA curves, rolldown metrics.
- `risk_appetite/` – liquidity and stress monitors.

Include a lightweight README in each folder describing inputs, methods, and how to run tests.
